# William's Console: Revisited
William's Console: Revisited is a modpack that attempts to expand onto an idea; what if LCE was modded?

## üì• Installation Guide
There are multiple ways to install and experience William's Console: Revisited.
### Modrinth Launcher (Recommended)
For the easiest possible installation, we recommend using the Modrinth Launcher. It's light, easy to use, reasonably quick, and only takes a few clicks to set up. Once you have it installed, you can install William's Console: Revisited by searching for William's Console: Revisited in the Modpacks section.
### Prism Launcher
Although more complicated, you can install Prism Launcher from their website. Prism is much more versatile and stronger as a launcher, but has a worse GUI. From there, add an instance and search for "William's Console: Revisited" in the Modrinth section.

### ‚≠ê Legacy Console Edition accuracy
William's Console: Revisited seeks to be accurate to an idea of "Legacy Console Edition if it never ended". This means the modpack does not seek to re-create old versions, but rather make LCE in the modern versions. It has titular features of LCE, including the Crafting Menu, gamma, creative menu and more!

If you are interested in a re-creation of old versions, check out [William's Console: Revisited: Legacy](https://modrinth.com/modpack/rc-legacy)


### üöÄ Major performance improvement
William's Console: Revisited is built off and kept in sync with [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin), the OptiFine alternative officially endorsed by Sodium.
William's Console: Revisited's goal is to significantly improve rendering and game logic performance, along with memory and hardware usage, without compromising on the game's looks or features in any way.
Additive is based on and kept in sync with the Adrenaline modpack. This means William's Console: Revisited comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed

### üí° OptiFine Features
William's Console: Revisited features and utilizes various mods that offers the same features that OptiFine does while also being modular so that you can remove features you don't want or features that are incompatible with other mods.
This includes major resource pack features, dynamic lighting, better grass and snow and more.

### üí° Misc. Features
William's Console: Revisited features some mods unrelated to LCE or OptiFine. This includes a small list of features:
- A programmer art add-on which retextures the game
- An easy to use calculator which can calculate anything from basic calculations to nether portal calculations, farm rate calculations and more.
- Borderless fullscreen mode
- Customizable Player Models
- Discord rich presence
- Input fixes for MacOS and Linux
- Optional old world generation, spanning from Classic Edition to 1.17.1

### ‚öôÔ∏è Open Source
William's Console: Revisited is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, William's Console: Revisited would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!

### üì© Up to Date
William's Console: Revisited is usually one of the first modpacks to update in a stable state to new Minecraft and Legacy4J versions. It is also multi-version and multi-loader, giving you the choice between Latest MC (currently 1.21.4) and a version with long-term mod compatibility (currently 1.21.1) on Fabric and Neoforge.
