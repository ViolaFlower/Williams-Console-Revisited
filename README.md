William's Console: Revisited (or "WC:R" for short) is a remastered release of the William's Console modpack, with more modded terrain generation, features and a generally more polished experience.

# 🎯 Goals

### 🎯 Replayability
WC:R seeks to give a replayable, diverse experience! Whether it be via a new combat system, awesome terrain generation, or new mobs, it delivers a dynamic playthrough every time you play it.

### ⚙️ Open Source
WC:R is comprised of only open-source or source-available mods, which gives you the ability to see the code and contribute to the mods in the pack. Without mod developers hard work, this modpack would not be possible. If you want to show the developers of these mods your appreciation, I encourage you to donate to them!

### 🚀 Performant
William's Console: Revisited is built off of Re-Console, which is built off of [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline).
This means it comes with all the features within [Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline), including;
- Improved rendering & game logic performance
- Improved memory and hardware usage
- Improved world generation speed
